## Usage
### Prefabs
#### DeformableSurface
- Set root's `TransformLinker` parent to the `palmbase` of hand
- Configure `width`, `height` and `HandCoordinateManager` (a hand proxy) of `DeformableCoordinateManager`
- Set the `handIndex` in `PlaneMeshGenerator` of the `Surface` GameObject. This refers to one of the `HandCoordinateManager`s in the `HandsManager`. The index refers to the index on the list of `HandCoordinateManager`s.
- Configure parents in `TransformLinker` of the `PlaneMeshTransformAnchors` GameObject
- Configure the offset by modifying the transform of the `offset` GameObject
- Add the instantiated prefab to the `managers` list in `CalibrateButton2` (in `InteractionManager` prefab)
#### InteractionManager
- This has the `InteractionManager` component and also the `HandsManager` component. One instance of this prefab must be in the scene.
- Add the `HandCoordinateManager` in the corresponding indices under the `HandCoordinateManager` of the `HandManager` component.
- This also houses the `ThumbCollider` which dictates when a button can get triggered.
- The `InteractionManager` component dictates which `ButtonController` gets triggered when the `ThumbCollider` interacts with them.
- This also has the `CalibrateButton2`, which is used to setup the deformable surfaces. (`InteractionManager` > `TriggerBase` > `contactBtn`). When wearing the HMD you can trigger this by moving the thumb close to the base of the index. In Editor, you can configure a canvas button to trigger the `OnClick` method in the `CalibrateButton2` component. All deformable surfaces must be added to the list of `managers` in this component.
#### OVRHandCoordinateProxyR
- Represents the proxy for the right hand when used with the OVRCustomHandPrefab from the oculus plugin.
- Drop this into the scene, and set the `SkeletonRoot` to the `OVRCustomHandPrefab` representing the right hand.
- Set the `TransformLinker`'s parent of `PalmBase_base` to `b_r_wrist` on the `OVRCustomHandPrefab` representing the right hand.
### Scripts
#### HandCoordinateManager
- Use this to abstract the platform specific details of the hand coordinates used by HPUI. See `OVRHandCoordinateProxyR` for example.
- Set the `SkeletonRoot` to the GameObject that represents all the joints of the hand
- Set the GameObject representing the palm base as `PalmBase`
- Under `ManagedCoordinates`, list all the locations you may track.
- Under `ProxyToSeletonNameMapping`, add the proxyname and corresponding name on the skeleton being abstracted.
